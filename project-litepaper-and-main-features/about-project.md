# About project

## Introduction

The first widely known cryptocurrency Bitcoin changed the rules of the game in its time. It was a real financial endgame that led to the creation of a multi-trillion crypto industry (as of 2024)

Being true fans and geeks who are inspired by cryptocurrency and the technologies/principles that underlie it, we also want to offer the world our project.

> **The idea was to create not another clone/fork, but a truly useful and long-lasting product. To do this, we have collected the best practices in the crypto industry, collected the most powerful and popular technologies and cryptography and are going to create a powerful foundation for the future decentralized ecosystem of services**

## What you can find here ?

### Decentralized L1 chain as a foundation for experiments

Klyntar is a decentralized L1 network. The same as Ethereum, Solana, TON and many others! You will be familiar with working with our project.

### Maximum decentralization: Multistaking - a nextgen liquid restaking

In an effort to increase decentralization rates and protect the network, as well as other chains in the ecosystem, we are introducing a multi-staking mechanism - now you can protect the network by delegating your coins from other projects. This increases the number of potential validators in the Klyntar network, which makes the network stronger, more resilient and reliable!

### Interesting architecture: Multilevel sharding

As we think about the future, we are trying to solve the problem of network scaling right away. Dividing the network into several smaller networks (**shards**) has become a standard in the industry.

We decided to go further and use a multilevel sharding system for greater efficiency. It is like classic sharding, but it has its advantages.

### Advanced cryptography

Any **crypto**currency contains the word **`crypto`**, which means that cryptography plays an important role in its basis.

In our project, we have collected the most popular and powerful hashing algorithms, signatures and others to use onchain and offchain.
