# About project

## Introduction

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The first widely known cryptocurrency Bitcoin changed the rules of the game in its time. It was a real financial endgame that led to the creation of a multi-trillion crypto industry (as of 2024)

Being true fans and geeks who are inspired by cryptocurrency and the technologies/principles that underlie it, we also want to offer the world our project.

> **The idea was to create not another clone/fork, but a truly useful and long-lasting product. To do this, we have collected the best practices in the crypto industry, collected the most powerful and popular technologies and cryptography and are going to create a powerful foundation for the future decentralized ecosystem of services**

## What you can find here ?

### Decentralized L1 chain as a foundation for experiments

Klyntar is a decentralized L1 network. The same as Ethereum, Solana, TON and many others! You will be familiar with working with our project.

### Maximum decentralization: Multistaking - multichain multiasset liquid staking for max security

In an effort to increase decentralization rates and protect the network, as well as other chains in the ecosystem, we are introducing a **multistaking mechanism** - now you can protect the network by delegating your coins and tokens from other projects. This increases the number of potential validators in the Klyntar network, which makes the network stronger, more resilient and reliable!

### Interesting architecture: Multilevel sharding

As we think about the future, we are trying to solve the problem of network scaling right away. Dividing the network into several smaller networks (**shards**) has become a standard in the industry.

We decided to go further and use a multilevel sharding system for greater efficiency. It is like classic sharding, but it has its advantages.

### Advanced cryptography

Any **crypto**currency contains the word **`crypto`**, which means that cryptography plays an important role in its basis.

In our project, we have collected the most popular and powerful hashing algorithms, signatures and others to use onchain and offchain.

### XVM - WASM VM, EVM and any-VM (Move, Solana VM) via containers&#x20;

We want to expand the possibilities of writing smart contracts for our chain as much as possible, so you will have access to the capabilities of the two most popular virtual machines - EVM and WASM.

Another big extension - **containers**. Use the full power of ready codebases from package managers of popular programming languages - JS, Python, Rust, C-langs, Go and much more! Use the native access to the Internet, own schemes of parallelizations, access to GPU, external databases and so on.

Creating smart-contracts here is like average programming - no special restrictions. Full freedom for your masterpieces :relaxed:

And in the future, there will be more!

### Codeless smart-contracts - road to smart-contracts usage in real-world business

Codeless smart contracts will help in cases when you need to make a deal that requires protection from a decentralized network, but which is difficult to program as a code.

**For example, this could be control of a deal on RWA, protection of your deal in a Web2 online store, some verbal agreement in real life!**

Don't trust - verify. Delegate control of the security of your contract to the network and rest assured.

No code is needed - make a deal using a simple interface. Form the conditions with words. And our network using controllers and AI will help you

### Ecosystem of blockchains

Shared security model, common cross-chain interaction API and so on.

### Ecosystem of services

Having a powerful L1 chain and many features in our arsenal, we want to be useful for a variety of use cases. In addition to DApps that will be built on the network, we are also going to create services on our side that will expand the scope of our cryptocurrency.

Such useful services can be applications for RWA, insurance, human rights protection, protection of deals in the real world, AI applications, on-chain services. We plan to make a big bet on RWA and Web2 thanks to our [codeless contracts](about-project.md#codeless-smart-contracts-road-to-smart-contracts-usage-in-real-world-business) and maximum security thanks to [multistaking](about-project.md#maximum-decentralization-multistaking-multichain-multiasset-liquid-staking-for-max-security).
