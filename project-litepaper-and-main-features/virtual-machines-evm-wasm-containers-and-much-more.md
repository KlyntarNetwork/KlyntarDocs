# Virtual machines - EVM, WASM, containers and much more!

## Intro

We want to expand the possibilities of writing smart contracts for our chain as much as possible, so you will have access to the capabilities of the two most popular virtual machines - EVM and WASM. And in the future, there will be more!

## EVM

The most popular virtual machine that immediately gives us compatibility with many popular DApps - stablecoin contracts, DEX, marketplaces, etc. can be immediately deployed to use the capabilities of Klyntar.

It also gives us the ability to be compatible with wallets, SDKs, and other Web3 products for EVM chains

## WASM

WebAssembly bytecode can be derived from popular languages ​​such as Rust, C/C++, AssemblyScript and many more! Learn more here
