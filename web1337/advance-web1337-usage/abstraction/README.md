### 1. Gas Abstraction 🟢

Extension to use everything what has a value as a fee. Execute smart-contracts or average address-address transactions by paying fees in memecoins, stablecoins or any other asset. Any chain, any asset.

### 2. Storage Abstraction 🟢

Extension to make storage usage fair. This mechanism forces contract creators to pay for storage used by their contracts. Good solution for long-term storage use planning - for users & validators
