# Multichain multiasset staking

## Intro

In an effort to increase decentralization rates and protect the network, as well as other chains in the ecosystem, we are introducing a new mechanism - now you can protect the network by delegating your coins, tokens from other projects. Also, you can use **social value points** - details will be later :wink:

This increases the number of potential validators in the Klyntar network, which makes the network stronger, more resilient and reliable!

### How it works ?

On the page with information about the validator, you will notice the **multistaking points** section. These points are credited to the validator when you stake coins/tokens on other blockchains in smart contracts or use your social value points to delegate to validator.

For this, validators will credit you with part of their rewards depending on the % that you staked.
