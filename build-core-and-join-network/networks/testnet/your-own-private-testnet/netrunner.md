# Netrunner

## Intro

Netrunner is a specialized tool for quickly launching a testnet. Literally using a couple of commands, you can deploy a local network of different sizes in order to:

1. Test smart contracts
2. Test system operations (staking, voting, etc.)
3. Improve the core code and instantly test your changes. Debug, etc.

## Currently supported configurations:

{% hint style="info" %}
The notation **Vx** means number of validators and size of network
{% endhint %}

1. V1 - testnet with a single validator
2. V2 - testnet with 2 validators
3. V5 - testnet with 5 validators
4. V21 - testnet with 21 validators
